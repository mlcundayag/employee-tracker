SQL Challenge: Employee Tracker

## Description

In this challenge I created a content management system that allows user input. I primarily use <code>inquirer</code> to take user input from the terminal and ![MYSQL](https://img.shields.io/badge/MySQL-005C84?style=for-the-badge&logo=mysql&logoColor=white) to store data to a database. 

I was able to create an employee tracker that can view departments, roles, and employees. Additionally, you can view employees by manager or department. You can also view budget by department. The employee tracker app can also ADD, UPDATE and DELETE. 

I was able to successfully create a functioning employee tracker without any errors.
